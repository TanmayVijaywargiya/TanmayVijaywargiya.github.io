						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned was how important white space is for the focus of a website. I have been in the consulting space for a while now and I think there is an effort for people to put lots of information on certain slides so the clients have all their content even when we aren't there to explain. As a result,
								it's intersting that since I was thinking of website visitors as clients - that is not the case. Websites have to be easily readable and white spaces added a cleanliness. Therefore, white space is needed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is the mythbusting of white space being considered wasted space. There is a thought that white space should be filled in because there is always more to give and provide to the end user. However, it should be balanced with a focus on certain contents. Therefore, the way they provided counterexamples for this specific myth was a cool thing to see. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When in doubt, add more white spaceâ€¦" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
