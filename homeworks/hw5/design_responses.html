                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned is how important having good visuals is to the end user (I tend to prefer works that are more content heavy rather than good looking so this is giving me a fresh perspective). If the visuals are not that good, then it would not entice me to use it as much. I think having a good-UI is legitimately the difference between a successful and non-successfull product. This is barring even if the content is good on both platforms.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite parts were the interactive visuals. They were much more dynamic than typical photos that were on other websites and articles we saw. The interactive gifs made it much more apparently how the UI would be used. This makes it easier to understand how we should make the UI very user friendly and not only pretty.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite was the easygrow app. I am terrible with plants and I think this would help me actually grow them - growing plants is a goal of mine. The app also makes growing plants so much more technical and scientific looking which is cool. I love how it is so easy to swipe, see graphs, and the visuals just pop. This makes the app super noticeable and beautiful to look at.  </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 7. I think the inspirations were fun to look at but I wish there was more content backing up why the person created their inspiration as such and what they were trying to accomplish. </p>
