        Hey, I'm Tanmay and this is my 4th year at Berkeley. I was born to Indian immigrants in Michigan and I've spent time in both Chicago and Florida. I love to play golf and tennis (I still play them competitively as part of the Berkeley Club Golf Team and BTA tennis). I also like to watch and follow sports of all kinds (Miami Heat fan) - even including the Olympics! 
        Some things I like are thrill activities (ex. skydiving and scuba), spicy foods, and geography. I can name almost every country in the world and locate them on a map. Regarding career growth, I'm excited to found my own startup in the future and be part of the web design community!

      I generally like to spend my time on ESPN, YouTube, and Instagram mostly; here is my favorite website that's a bit unique:

      Here are my answers to the article questions:  
    </p>

      <ul>
          <li>1) I learned how getting better at design starts with deconstructing many of the visuals we see on apps in our daily life. The article has made me rethink how I choose certain products over other simply because of their design: ex. Apple vs Android.
              Something else I learned was how design can be very subtle and these can create incentives to excite me into using certain features: ex. London in the Search bar.
          </li>
          <li>2) My favorite parts of the article was the inclusion of the gifs. I think many articles don't utilize as many photos as I think are needed since it's important for us to get visual representations of content (maybe this is how my mind has changed due to lots of time on instagram!). 
            Especially since this is a design article, it is vital that the use of gifs could provide me with the visual cues that accompanied how design can capture the individual.
             </li>
          <li>3) "As you watch each component build upon the next, be curious about everything you see and think through the choices that had to be made for this product."</li>
          <li>4) 8
