						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how accessibility can extend beyond simply what I thought it was before. Now I realize there are also legal implications for accessibility which are interesting. You can get sued! Another thing I learned
								is how accessibility is very important color-wise. Most of this article was centered around color which is just not the first thing I think about when I envision accessibility.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was referencing a color system and palette. I think it happens so often where I don't document my findings or take notes and then they are lost in my memory or can't be shared easily with others. 
								Therefore, it was interesting to see how documentation is important even for color because it will save time especially when working in a group. The don't be rude quote was also pretty funny. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> 'In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least 814 federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions.' </p>
						</li>
